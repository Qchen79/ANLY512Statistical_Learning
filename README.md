## SUMMARY
Here, we can keep a running summary of our project.We investigated four primary aspects of the impact of the US interest rate: how it impacts foreign investment in the US, how it impacts foreign interest rates, how it impacts the unemployment rate, and what future rates will be. We utilized a number of different methods to delve into these relationships to better understand how the US interest rate impacts various aspects of the economy. Throughout this Github repository, you'll see our data collection, data cleaning, and data analysis, as well as some initial interpretation of results for our final project.


## INTRODUCTION: 
Housing prices, unemployment, international markets, global investment, future business, and the stock market each have one thing in common: the US interest rate. The US interest rate is set by the Federal Reserve, a financial governing body located in DC with district branches located around the US. As the world has recovered from the COVID-19 economic crisis, the Federal Reserve has chosen to increase interest rates, which is having a cascading effect around the globe. Many other countries follow the US interest rate, and investors in the US and around the globe dictate their investment spending based on this one number. In this project, we are going to use some statistical modelling techniques to dive into some of the relationships between the US interest rate and other US and global economic indicators to better understand what this rate means and what it affects. 


## WHAT IS THE US INTEREST RATE? 
The US interest rate, or the Federal Funds Rate, is the interest rate set by the Fed for commercial banksâ€™ lending. It is one of many interest rates set by the Fed that affects the global economy. The Fed adjusts the rate to encourage or discourage spending, depending on the global economic environment. When the Fed raises rates, it discourages investment and slows down the economy; when it lowers rates, it promotes spending and spurs growth. In 2023, the global economy is booming following the recession caused by COVID-19. With inflation rising, the Fed has decided to raise rates to balance economic growth against rising prices. The Fed is also raising rates now so that it can lower them in the future to encourage growth, were an economic downturn to occur. In this project, we seek to examine how this  interest rate affects the US and global economy via data science.

## ABOUT DATA SET:
we sought data from sources that represented different phases of the project. 
* ***OCED US Long term interest rate:***: This dataset contains the US interest rate, other countries interest rate you can select different countries or different time period for the interest rate. And the time period we use is from 2007 to 2023. Retrieved from: https://data.oecd.org/interest/short-term-interest-rates.htm#indicator-chart
* ***Bureau of Economic Analysis. Direct Investment by Country and Industry***: This dataset is about Investment value of major countries in the United States and the time period we use is from 2007 to 2023.

## CONCLUSION: 
In conclusion, we see that the US interest rate impact not only the domestic economy, but international economies as well. This interest rate is difficult to predict, most likely because it is impacted by numerous external factors and is used to dictate other changing factors, such as unemployment rates and inflation. The rate set by the Fed apparently impacts numerous economic outcomes, and thus the increase or decrease in this rate is worthwhile to study and attempt to predict, as financial, foreign, investment, and future markets depend on these decisions. Overall, we found that there is much to be gained from analyzing the US Federal Funds interest rate and there is room for further analysis to find other avenues of study on how US interest rates change over time.
